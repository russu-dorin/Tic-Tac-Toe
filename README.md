# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #5

## Title
Collaboration. Complex application.

## Contents
* Collaboration
* All previously studied things

## Completed Mandatory Objectives
* Create an application which has:
  * Child windows controls

## Completed Objectives With Points
* Work on this project in a team of 3 **(2 pt)**
  * Divide tasks and describe them in readme (for each task indicate who is responsible for it) **(1 pt)**
* Make it useful (you may ask me to evaluate usefulness of your application idea) **(0-3 pt)**

## The application creation steps
This Laboratory work was an interesting challenge. We are three people in the team: Dumitru Cotet, Dorin Russu and Sasha Plesco. We chose the topic as spontaneously as we created the team. It’s a simple Tic Tac Toe game. Sasha created the design, logo and icons, but she forgot to add the sketches at the beginning of the work. After that, Dorin created the logo window as the start of our practical implementation. Dima added the second window and the game interface in concordance with Sasha’s design – menus, controls, icons, etc. At this moment, it has only the possibility of Two Player game.  The functionality of playing with computer wasn’t added because of the deadline. We started this module with artificial intelligence and it’s almost done, but Dorin, who was working on it, wasn’t able to add it today because of his unplanned activity. Even though, the game can be played between two persons and is fully functional. There is also a counter for each player.

## The application contains:
1. Start window with logo

2. Game window with different controls:

    2.1 File and About menus
	
    2.2 The text element that says whos turn is
    
	2.3 The Restart Button (is activated only when the game is over)
    
	2.4 9 Controls for each cell of the Tic-Tac-Toe game
    
	2.5 The player's scores

## Outro
It was an interesting laboratory work. We regret a little bit the fact that we didn’t manage to implement all our ideas, but it is good though. It was fun.
